### `1`

The tech stack used in this assignment is React with Material UI. 

### `2`

At first I split the UI into 3 components, the form, header, and the part to display the logos.

### `3`

The header component serves as the header layout for all the the other components. At first I captured the company name and slogan at form component with the help of a form. 

### `4`

I passed that data from the form component to the display component. Using React Router I split the application into two pages, the homepage, and the display page for the logos. 

### `5`

Once the user clicks the continue button, I used setTimeout with useEffect to mock a loading progress as if the logos are being generated on the backend. 

### `6`

To generate the logos, I downloaded six different logos with no caption and then using absolute positioning in css, I positioned the company name at different positions around the Logo.
